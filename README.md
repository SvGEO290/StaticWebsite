All the files are added into this repository, and there is a zip file to download it yourself. I used live server extension to run and see my browser after I completed it.
The launch.json file is in a .vscode file on my computer, but it also was no there when I compressed my project file folder into a zip file for anyone to download.

This is all for now.
